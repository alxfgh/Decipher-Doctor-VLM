# Doctor Handwriting Reader

## Overview

This project aims to fine-tune Vision Language Models (VLMs) on doctor handwriting to improve the readability and interpretation of medical prescriptions and notes. We're creating synthetic data to enhance model's performance and make it more accessible through the Decipher Doctor platform.

## Features

- Fine-tuning of Qwen2-VL for doctor handwriting recognition
- Synthetic data generation for improved model performance
- Open-source initiative to enhance medical communication

## Compute Resources

We're actively looking for compute resources to accelerate our synthetic data generation and model fine-tuning. If you can provide GPU time or other computational resources, please contact us.
